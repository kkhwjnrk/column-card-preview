# 3 Card Preview Component 📄🃏

👋 Hello! This project is my submission for the 3 Card Preview Component challenge from Frontend Mentor. In this challenge, I created a responsive component using HTML and SCSS. I took a mobile-first approach to ensure the design is responsive across multiple screen sizes.

### Design 🎨

The profile card component showcases a background image and a content section that displays the user's profile image, name, age, and location. The component also includes a social statistics section showcasing the user's follower count, number of likes, and photos. For an example, please visit the [Mobile](./design/mobile-design.jpg) and [Desktop design](./design/desktop-design.jpg).
